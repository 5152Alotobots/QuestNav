title: Choosing an Ethernet Adapter

# QuestNav Recommended USB to Ethernet Adapters

First, you'll need a USB to Ethernet adapter. The Quest 3/3s has a USB-C port that can be used for this purpose, with a dongle. It is imperative you choose from this list if possible as Android fails to enumerate some USB to Ethernet adapters as it was never designed for this purpose.

## Recommended Adapters
The list below includes pictures, links, and other information for USB to Ethernet adapters known to work with Quest headsets, our most recommended choices are nearest to the top. We highly suggest that you use an adapter with power pass through to keep your headset charged during the match.

**Note:** I've had some success using USB splitters like [this one](https://a.co/d/42pHOMf) with a USB-C to Ethernet dongle. However, vibration appears to have made this adapter less reliable over time. Your mileage may vary.
